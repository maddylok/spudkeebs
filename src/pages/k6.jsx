            my very first mechanical keyboard. when i was a mere newbie in the hobby. i made the mistake of not ordering it hot-swappable,
            purely because i didn't do enough research to understand what hot-swappable meant and went with the cheaper option.
            nevertheless, i still love this board in all its stock-ness. i did replace the keychron keycaps with
            a botanical keycap set i found on amazon, as i don't love the grey/orange colorway of the
            stock keychron keycap sets.

            my k6 only has the white backlight which i really like,
            though keychron does offer the option for full rgb. there are so many different modes for the backlight as well. i don't love
            65% keyboards anymore, as i really enjoy having function keys, but in college i didn't have a real desk, so the smaller size was perfect.

            i've found that the gateron brown switches are not the best after trying plenty of other
            more expensive and "nicer" switches, but if you just want a good keyboard for typing, this will do fine.
            keychron also offers gateron reds (linears) or gateron blue (clicky), all for the
            same pricepoint.

          <p>
            for beginner keyboards, or for those who don't really care too much about keebs, i would highly recommend keychron. they are very
            customizable (as long as you get the hot-swappable version or you have the patience for soldering). keychron boards have both mac and windows
            compatibility as well! keychron also offers many different layouts. if you want a recommendation for a good keychron board,
            i suggest the keychron Q1.
